    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>  I began learning how to code C# in Unity in 2018 and launched my first app on the Play Store in 2019. Software development is my passion. 
        The creative and problem-solving mindset that is required by coding is why I love programming and will make a valued addition to any team. I am seeking an opportunity to further spark my professional development. 
        Every problem has a solution, I hope I am always as excited as I am today to solve them.
