            <p>2018 - Current Unity, C# Developer</p>
            <p>
                In 2019 my first app launched on the Google Play Store.
                I have also been learning how to market products using Google Ads in order to reach a larger audience with this and future releases.
                I have also been working on smaller side projects which include smaller games and react based websites as well as my passion project. My passion project is a city building strategy game that has an in-game intelligence system, which is intended to allow for a greater level of realism. Making games is a huge challenge but I welcome it.

            <p>2018 – Current Blender, 3D Modeler and Animator</p>
            <p>
                When creating games for my unity projects, I came across the obstacle of the limited library unity offered. 
                I taught myself how to use Blender, now I’m experienced with its interface, 3D modelling methods and animation.
